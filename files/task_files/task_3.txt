You are tasked to do the following activity. Imagine you are given a rule about passwords
for users on some arbitrary system, it is your job to find out if the rule was broken.
The rule is: "If a user's password contains a special character, then it must be at least
eight characters long.". You are tasked with finding out if the rule was broken only given
a single piece of information about each of the four passwords. The information is as follows
password1 has a special character, password2 is five characters long, password3 is nine characters long,
and password4 does not have a special character. What passwords must you reveal in order to see
if the rule was broken. Respond yes for each password you want to reveal and no if you don't
want to reveal it.  Respond yes or no for each password in the following JSON
format, where each password's JSON key is 'param' followed by the password number
and the value is either yes or no. An example response if you'd like to
reveal password1, password2 and not reveal over password3 and password4 would be,
{"param1": "yes", "param2": "yes", "param3": "no", "param4": "no"}.
