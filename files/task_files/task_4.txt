You are shown a set of blankets placed on the floor of a gymnasium,
each of which has a disease on one side and a nation on the other.
Blanket 1 shows polio, blanket 2 shows lymphoma, blanket 3 shows greece and blanket 4 shows brazil.
Which blanket(s) must you turn over in order to test that if a blanket shows a
form of cancer on one face, then its opposite face is a european country?
Respond yes for each blanket you want to flip over and no if you don't
want to reveal it. Do so in the following JSON format, where each blanket's
JSON key is 'param' followed by the blankets number
and the value is either yes or no. An example response if you'd like to
reveal blanket 1, blanket 2 and not reveal blanket 3 and blanket 4 would be,
{"param1": "yes", "param2": "yes", "param3": "no", "param4": "no"}.
