You are logically tasked by a therapist to do the following activity.
Imagine you are given a rule about a house, and you wish to find out if a
rule was broken. The rule is as follows: 'If the room has a flower on the
door, there is a pink bed inside'. You are only told one piece of
information about each room which is as follows: Room 1 has a flower on the
door, Room 2 has a name on the door, Room 3 has a pink bed inside it,
Room 4 has a blue bed inside it. Which room(s) should you investigate in
order finding out if the rule was broken?  Respond yes or no for each room
you'd like to investigate in the following JSON format, where each room's
JSON key is 'param' followed by the room number and the value is either yes
or no. An example response if you'd like to investigate Room 1, Room 2 and
not investigate Room 3 and Room 4 would be,
{"param1": "yes", "param2": "yes", "param3": "no", "param4": "no"}.
