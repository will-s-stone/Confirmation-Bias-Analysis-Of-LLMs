Scenario: You are assisting a researcher with a study on textiles.
The researcher has laid out several fabrics, each with a specific texture on one side and a specific color on the other.
The researcher wants to verify a rule: "If a fabric has a rough texture, it must be blue."

Fabrics:
Fabric 1: Texture - Smooth
Fabric 2: Texture - Rough
Fabric 3: Color - Blue
Fabric 4: Color - Red

Task: Determine which fabrics you need to investigate to verify if the rule is broken.
For each fabric, answer "yes" if you need to investigate a fabric, and "no" if you don't.
Respond with your answers in a JSON format, with each fabric number as a key and "yes" or "no" as the value.
Make sure to include all the key value pairs in your response.
Make sure the keys in your JSON response are all lowercase with no spaces.

Example: {"fabric1": "yes", "fabric2": "no", "fabric3": "no", "fabric4": "no"}
