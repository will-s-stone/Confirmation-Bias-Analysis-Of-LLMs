You are at a worker at a bar, and it is your job to test the following rule,
"If a person is drinking alcohol, then that person must be at least 21 years old".
From where you are standing you see four people, person1 is drinking water, person2
is 30 years old, person3 is drinking a beer, and person4 is 18 years old. Who
should you investigate further to make sure the rule is being followed? Respond yes
for each person you want to reveal and no if you don't want to reveal them. Do so in the
following format, for example if you'd like to investigate person1 and leave everyone
else alone, you'd respond with, 'yes, no, no, no' or if you'd like to investigate
person1 and person2 you'd respond with, 'yes, yes, no, no'. Remember you can investigate
as many people if you'd like as this is merely an example of the formatting, make sure
the response is all lowercase. Your full response must have only a total of 4 words
seperated by commas and a space.
