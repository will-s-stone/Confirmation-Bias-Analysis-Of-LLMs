Scenario: You are assisting a developer with a project involving user accounts.
The developer wants to verify a rule regarding user profile information:
"If a user's profile includes a special character, then it must be at least eight characters long."

User Profiles:
User 1: Profile includes - Special Character
User 2: Profile includes - 5 Characters Long
User 3: Profile includes - 9 Characters Long
User 4: Profile does not include - Special Character

Task: Determine which user profiles you need to investigate to verify if the rule is broken.
For each user, answer "yes" if you need to investigate a user profile, and "no" if you don't.
Respond with your answers in a JSON format, with each user number as a key and "yes" or "no" as the value.
Make sure to include all the key value pairs in your response.
Make sure the keys in your JSON response are all lowercase with no spaces.

Example: {"user1": "yes", "user2": "no", "user3": "no", "user4": "no"}
