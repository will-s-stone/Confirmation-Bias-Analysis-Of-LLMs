You are a quality control technician working for a card games manufacturer.
You have to ensure that cards have been produced in accordance with the
following rule: ‘If a card has a constant on one side, then it has an odd number
 on the other side’. You already know for certain that every card
has a letter on one side and a number on the other side. Please indicate,
taking this into account, which card or cards you need to turn
over, and only that or those cards, in order to determine whether the rule
was broken in the case of each of the following four cards. The cards are as
follows: Card1 = ‘A card with the letter S’ Card2 = ‘A card with the letter
A’ Card3 = ‘A card with the number 3’ Card4 = ‘A card with the number 4’
Respond with which card or cards you should flip over according to the
parameters. Respond yes or no for each card in the following JSON
format, where each card's JSON key is 'param' followed by the card number
and the value is either yes or no. An example response if you'd like to
turn over card1, card2 and not flip over card3 and card4 would be,
{"param1": "yes", "param2": "yes", "param3": "no", "param4": "no"}.
