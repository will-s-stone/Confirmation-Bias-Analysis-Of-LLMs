Scenario: You are a quality control inspector at a game card factory.
The cards have a letter on one side and a number on the other.
You need to check if the following rule is followed: "If a card has a consonant on one side,
it must have an odd number on the other side."

Cards:
Card 1: Letter "S"
Card 2: Letter "A"
Card 3: Number "3"
Card 4: Number "4"

Task: For each card, decide whether you need to flip it to verify if the rule is broken.
Answer "yes" if you need to flip it, and "no" if you don't.
Respond with your answers in a JSON format, with each card number as a key and "yes" or "no" as the value.
Make sure to include all the key value pairs in your response.
Make sure the keys in your JSON response are all lowercase with no spaces.

Example: {"card1": "yes", "card2": "no", "card3": "no", "card4": "yes"}
