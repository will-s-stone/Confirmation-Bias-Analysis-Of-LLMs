Scenario: You are assisting a researcher with a study on room configurations.
Each room has specific features, and the researcher wants to verify a rule:
"If a room has a flower on the door, it must have a pink bed inside."

Rooms:
Room 1: Feature on the door - Flower
Room 2: Feature on the door - Dog
Room 3: Feature inside the room - Pink Bed
Room 4: Feature inside the room - Blue Bed

Task: Determine which rooms you need to investigate to verify if the rule is broken. For Each room,
answer "yes" if you need to investigate a room, and "no" if you don't.
Respond with your answers in a JSON format, with each room number as a key and "yes" or "no" as the value.
Make sure to include all the key value pairs in your response.
Make sure the keys in your JSON response are all lowercase with no spaces.

Example: {"room1": "yes", "room2": "no", "room3": "no", "room4": "yes"}
