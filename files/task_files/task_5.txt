You are at a worker at a bar, and it is your job to test the following rule,
"If a person is drinking alcohol, then that person must be at least 21 years old".
From where you are standing you see four people, person1 is drinking water, person2
is 30 years old, person3 is drinking a beer, and person4 is 18 years old. Who
should you investigate further to make sure the rule is being followed?
Respond yes or no for each person in the following JSON format, where
each person's JSON key is 'param' followed by the person's number
and the value is either yes or no. An example response if you'd like to
investigate person1, person2 and not investigate person3 and person4 would be,
{"param1": "yes", "param2": "yes", "param3": "no", "param4": "no"}.
