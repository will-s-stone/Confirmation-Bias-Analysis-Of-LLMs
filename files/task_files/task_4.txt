Scenario: You are assisting a researcher with a study on textiles.
The researcher has laid out several fabrics, each with a specific texture on one side and a specific color on the other.
The researcher wants to verify a rule: "If a fabric has a rough texture, it must be blue."

Fabrics:
Fabric 1: Texture - Smooth
Fabric 2: Texture - Rough
Fabric 3: Color - Blue
Fabric 4: Color - Red

Task: Determine which fabrics you need to investigate to verify if the rule is broken.
Answer "yes" if you need to investigate a fabric, and "no" if you don't.
Respond with your answers in a JSON format, with each fabric number as a key and "yes" or "no" as the value.

Example: {"fabric1": "yes", "fabric2": "no", "fabric3": "no", "fabric4": "no"}
